# Chess Knight Shortest Path

This project calculates the shortest path that a knight can take on a 8x8 chessboard from a starting position (A) to an ending position (B). It utilizes the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the chessboard and find the optimal path.

## Usage
To use this code, you must first open main.py file and edit the following values as wanted:
* A position on chessboard:
    ```python
    a = (0, 0)
    ```
* B position on chessboard:
    ```python
    b = (7, 7)
    ```
After that, by running the Python code, the result will be displayed in the terminal.
```bash
python main.py
```
